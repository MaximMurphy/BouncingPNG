# BouncingPNG

This is a simple JavaScript program to animate any PNG file like the DVD logo screensaver. The image will update its color and change directions when it hits a wall. This was implemented using the JavaScript Library P5.js.

To run this, open index.html with a live server. PNG files can be added and the file path in line 10 of sketch.js can be updated accordingly for the new PNG.

Watch example.mov to see an example of a logo bouncing in an iphone screen sized canvas.
