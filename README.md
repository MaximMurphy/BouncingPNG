# BouncingPNG

This is a simple JavaScript program to animate any PNG file like the DVD logo screensaver. The image will update its color and change directions when it hits a wall.

To run this, open index.html with a live server. PNG files can be added and the file path in line 10 of sketch.js can be updated accordingly for the new PNG.
